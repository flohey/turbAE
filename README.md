# turbAE
Convolutional Autoencoder (AE) for e.g., two-dimensional turbulent fluid flows. Besides an example, a helper class for keeping track of all hyperparameters and file paths is provided in the `ae_class.py` file. The AE is implemented using the PyTorch library.

## Examples
- Two-dimensinal Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection at ${\rm Ra}= 10^6$ and ${\rm Pr}= 10$ in a rectangular box with aspect ratio $\Gamma = L_X/H = 4$. The boundary conditions were free-slip and constant temperature.

## Manual
For a tutorial, see the prepared IPython Notebook `tutorial.ipynb` under /examples/two_dimensional_rbc/

## Introduction to Autoencoders
Autoencoders are feed-forward neural networks that map an input back to itself. In the course of a classical Autoencoder network, the input dimension is drastically reduced, yielding a reduced-order representation of the original input.
This makes them a suitable tool for Reduced Order Modeling applications, such as the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). However, while the POD is a linear method, the AE extends the notion of this data reduction technique towards nonlinear methods.
